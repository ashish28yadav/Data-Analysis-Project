# 🏏 T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analysis

##  Context
Cricket, especially in its T20 format, has become a high-stakes, data-driven sport where team strategies, player performances, and match outcomes are closely scrutinized. With growing reliance on analytics, stakeholders such as coaches, analysts, and fans are seeking deeper insights into the game using historical match data.

This project focuses on T20 World Cup tournaments and aims to convert raw and structured cricket data into meaningful visual insights. Using data science techniques, it enables informed decision-making in areas like team selection, player evaluation, and match strategy.

##  Problem Statement
The International Cricket Board and team analysts want to make data-backed decisions to improve on-field performance during the T20 World Cup. The objective is to build an end-to-end analytics solution that preprocesses and models match and player data, creates interactive dashboards, and provides actionable insights — including an optimal **Best Playing XI**.

---

##  Objective
Build a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project to:

- Clean and preprocess match and player data
- Analyze matches, players, and team performances across tournaments
- Visualize key cricket metrics and insights using Power BI dashboards
- Generate a data-driven "Best XI" using custom cricket logic
- Implement DAX for advanced cricket KPIs and performance filters

##  Final Results

To complete this project:

-  **Python** was used to scrape, clean, and preprocess the raw JSON data into structured CSV format.
-  **Power BI** was used to create interactive dashboards.
-  **DAX** measures were developed for performance metrics, KPIs, and Best XI logic.
-  Visuals allow filtering by **team**, **venue**, **player**, and **match details**.
